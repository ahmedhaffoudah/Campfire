# Welcome to Campfire

Welcome to the Campfire GitHub repository. 

## Project
### Description
Campfire is a web application allowing users to interact through photos. The platform allows them to post, like, and comment on photos. Feeds are exclusively limited to photos uploaded by followed users. These users are therefore discovered through mouth-to-ear advertisement, providing a more organic experience.
### Objective
The objective of this web application is to apply knowledge learned through Concordia's SOEN 341 - SOFTWARE PROCESS course.
